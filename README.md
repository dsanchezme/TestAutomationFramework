# Challenge - Test Automation Framework   

Presenting a test automation framework for [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) - [API Layer](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started)

### Type 
**Modular**
- Test scripts are developed on the basis of modules or clusters by dividing the entire application into several small and self-sufficient blocks.
- The smaller modules in the framework communicate with each other in a hierarchical manner to form a large script which is capable of testing an entire scenario.

### Tools

- #### Library management 

  **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**

  - The process of project building is simplified and well organized.
  - Used before
  - It is not necessary to have such a customized building for this project. 

- #### Test runner
  
  **[TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/)**
 
  - Similar to [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), TestNG provides initialization and cleanup at the method and class level
  - TestNG offers some annotations for configurations at suite and group levels.

- #### Reporting 

  **[Allure](https://qameta.io/allure-report/)**
    - Compared to [ExtentReports](https://www.extentreports.com/) it is much easier to work with and has more features in built, specially the nice dashboard it provides.
    - Allure Reporting framework works fine with any test framework like TestNG.

- #### Logging

  **[Log4J 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/)**
  - Active community.
  - So like [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/), Log4j2 provides support for [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/), automatically reloads the log settings, and supports advanced filtering options.

- #### Serialization
  
  **[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)**
  - Itâ€™s a very fast and lightweight library.
  - It provides Data Binding functionality that can be used to convert Java objects into their JSON representation.
  - It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
  - It can be difficult to reverse certain operations performed by the library, such as converting back from JSON to Java.
  
  **[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)**
  - Simple tools for Java object JSON serialization and deserialization.
  - Extensive support of Java Generics.
  - Fast with a low memory footprint.
  - It allows a compact output and pretty printing.
